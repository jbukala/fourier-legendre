### Fourier-Legendre

Quick script in Haskell to take a signal (1-D or 2D/image eventually) and Fourier-Legendre transform it. 
Can be used as a form of compression by keeping only a few Legendre basis functions. 
Probably very inefficient unless the signal turns out to be sparse in the Legendre-domain.
